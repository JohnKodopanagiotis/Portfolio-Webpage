Personal Portfolio Webpage For FCC Using HTML + CSS. [Click here to see it live.](https://johnkodopanagiotis.github.io/Portfolio-Webpage/)


*DISCLAIMER
 THE PROJECTS LISTED IN THIS WEBPAGE ARE NOT MINE AND WERE USED ONLY AS DUMMIES TO MAKE THE WEBPAGE SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL PROJECT THAT FCC PROVIDED.
 I MADE THIS PROJECT AS PART OF THE freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.
 I PLAN TO UPDATE THEM WHEN I BUILD SIMILAR PROJECTS WITH MINE.
